Project Title: Digital Queue Management System for Canteen 
 
Objective: 
To develop a web-based and mobile-accessible system that allows students to 
join and track virtual queues for canteen orders, thereby minimizing physical 
waiting time and improving service efficiency. 
 
Scope of Work: 
The system will include modules for: 
• Online queue registration for canteen orders. 
• Real-time queue status updates and notifications. 
• Order and token management for canteen staff. 
• Payment integration and ticket generation for students. 
• Administrative dashboard for managing queues, users, and analytics. 
 
Proposed Solution: 
The solution will use a centralized database and a responsive web interface 
accessible to both students and canteen staff. Students can browse menu items, 
place orders online, and join a digital queue. The system will generate unique 
queue numbers and provide real-time updates to users as their order status 
progresses, ensuring an efficient and organized canteen experience. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Project Overview 
Introduction 
This document provides a comprehensive overview of our software product, outlining its 
parameters, goals, and the perspectives of our client, team, and target audience. It further 
details the project's intended user base, user interface specifications, and essential hardware 
and software requirements. 
 
Scope of Development Project 
Campus meals are meant to bring people together—not turn into a daily struggle. Yet, we’ve 
all seen the chaos: long queues, confused crowds, and everyone shouting to get their order 
first. Most existing mess apps only handle the basics like browsing the menu and making 
payments, but they don’t solve the real problem—the disorder that happens when everyone 
shows up at once. 
We believe there’s a smarter way. Our goal is to build MessMate, a clean and reliable mess 
management app designed to bring order, efficiency, and peace of mind to the dining 
experience. It’s not just another food ordering app—it’s a complete system that streamlines 
everything from placing an order to picking it up. 
Once a student places an order through the app, they’ll automatically receive a digital queue 
ticket with a unique number. The kitchen staff can then update order statuses in real time, 
and students get notified the moment their food is ready. No more waiting in crowded lines 
or shouting across counters—just calm, organized service. 
 
Here’s what makes MessMate special: 
1. Your Mess ID 
Forget waiting in long lines or shouting your name at the counter. With our app, you’ll create 
one simple digital profile—your Mess ID—containing your name, roll number, and 
preferences. From then on, placing an order is as easy as a single tap. It’s your personalized 
entry to a smoother dining experience. 
2. Order Made Simple 
Right after you log in, you’ll find a clean, easy-to-use interface to browse the day’s menu and 
place your order instantly. Whether it’s breakfast, lunch, or a late-night snack, everything you 
need is right at your fingertips. No confusion, no paperwork—just quick and effortless 
ordering. 
3. Smart Queue System 
Once you place an order, the app automatically generates a digital queue ticket with your 

 
unique number. No more crowding or chaos. The kitchen staff can manage the live queue 
efficiently, and you’ll receive real-time updates about your position and estimated waiting 
time. 
4. Instant Notification 
As soon as your food is ready, you’ll get a notification on your phone. The moment your 
number comes up, simply walk to the counter, show your ticket, and collect your order. It’s 
fast, fair, and frustration-free—everyone gets served in order, without the hassle. 
5. Effortless Management 
For mess staff, the app acts as a command center—track incoming orders, update statuses, 
and manage the queue all from one place. It simplifies operations, reduces confusion, and 
ensures every student gets their meal quickly and accurately. 
6. Reliable and Secure 
We’re building the system on a top-tier cloud platform to ensure that every order, ticket, 
and update is stored safely with automatic backups. No lost orders, no missed updates—just 
smooth, secure service every day.

Software requirement Specification 
(IEEE Format) 
 
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a 
comprehensive overview of the requirements for the MessMate – Enhanced 
Mess Management System. It serves as a key reference for all project 
stakeholders — including developers, testers, administrators, and end-users — to 
ensure a shared understanding of the system’s: 
• Functionalities: What the system is designed to accomplish in managing 
daily mess operations. 
• Performance expectations: How efficiently and reliably it should operate 
to minimize waiting times and improve service flow. 
• Design and operational constraints: Any system limitations, 
dependencies, or integration requirements. 
This document adheres to the IEEE Std 830-1998 standard for SRS and guides 
the development, testing, and validation of the MessMate system throughout its 
lifecycle. 
The MessMate platform is a web and mobile-based digital queue and meal 
management solution that simplifies the process of meal booking, order 
tracking, and queue management in campus mess environments. The system aims 
to enhance efficiency and user satisfaction by providing real-time updates, digital 
token generation, and role-based management for users, mess administrators, and 
kitchen staff. 
It supports the following major functions: 
• Online meal booking and cancellation 
• Special item purchase with secure digital payment 
• Automated ticket and queue generation 
• Real-time order tracking and status notifications 
• Menu and user management by mess administrators 

 
• Queue monitoring and order verification by kitchen staff 
This SRS defines: 
• All functional and non-functional requirements for the initial release of 
MessMate. 
• Key terms and acronyms (e.g., Queue ID, Token, Admin Panel, API, UI) 
used in the document. 
• Reference technical resources and APIs (e.g., payment gateways, 
notification APIs, and database integration tools) that support the 
implementation and operation of the system.
